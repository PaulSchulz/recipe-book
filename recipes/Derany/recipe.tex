                5 & Potatoes, medium size \\
                1 & Onion \\
                1 & Egg \\
  \unit[3]{tbsp} & All purpose flour \\
  \unit[1]{tbsp} & Sour cream \\
   \unit[1]{tsp} & Salt and pepper to taste \\
  \unit[2-3]{tbsp} & Oil, for frying \\
}{
    \item Prep all the ingredients. Peel potatoes and onion.
    
    \item In a big bowl,  grate potatoes and onion (on the star shaped zesting grater), 
    taking turns and mixing grated mixture. Onion juice will keep potatoes from browning.
    
    \item Add flour, egg, sour cream and mix it well, than add salt and
    some black pepper. 
    The batter should be liquid enough so you can easily ladle it.    
￼
    \item Warm up a skillet with oil over medium/high heat. 
    Add a spoon full of mixture at a time to the skillet fry on 
    one side until golden brown in color, then flip to other side and
    fry for the same amount of time. 
    
    \item Repeat with the rest of the batter.

    \item Serve warm, with sour cream.￼
